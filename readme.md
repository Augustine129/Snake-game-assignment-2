a. Summary and review of the problem, overall proposed solution.
 
This is a clone of the classic Tic Tac Toe game.
 
It starts by displaying players' signs, Player 1 is X and Player 2 is O.
 
Then it displays which turn it is .
 
Then instruct the user to enter a number between 1 and 9 which would allow the player to keep track of their position.
 
The game will have 3 rows and 3 columns which are numbered 1 through 9
 
As the player places markers on the game console it will update the board and it will notify the player of a turn.
 
If there is a winner it will show a message of which player has won.
 
If all markers are placed and there is no winner then it's a draw and the game stops.
 
If there is no winner it will keep playing.
