# Tic-Tac-Toe built in C# Assignement 2

Tic-Tac-Toe is a very simple game for two players. So only two players can play at a time. This game is also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os game. One player plays with X and the other player plays with O. In this game, we have a board that consists of a 3X3 grid.

#### a. *Summary and review of the problem, overall proposed solution.*
 
  - This is a clone of the classic Tic Tac Toe game.
 
  - It starts by displaying players' signs, Player 1 is X and Player 2 is O.
 
  - Then it displays which turn it is .
 
  - Then instruct the user to enter a number between 1 and 9 which would allow the player to keep track of their position.
    
  - The game will have 3 rows and 3 columns which are numbered 1 through 9
    
  - As the player places markers on the game console it will update the board and it will notify the player of a turn.
    
  - If there is a winner it will show a message of which player has won.
    
  - If all markers are placed and there is no winner then it's a draw and the game stops.
    
  - If there is no winner it will keep playing.

## Initial working plan, overall, development stategy and approach to quality:

My work plan is to divide the overall problem into smaller tasks, which were;

- Displaying the position of player 1.
- Display of player 2's position.
- Display of the 3 x 3 grid.

Each task will be noted on my to-do list and worked on individually, so I will take an agile approach to development. I will self-assess the quality of the code I have written through regular code reviews. This will help me identify any errors in my code. Throughout the development process, I will validate all user input and internal processes.

I have also decided to use version control. For this, I have used git. I created branches and PRs and merged the code into main.

I went through the requirements from the task and created a to do list for it. As shown in the following diagram


### Augustine to-do list 

List of things to do 

- Provide introductions to the game
 - Greetings
 - Display player 1 is X and player 2 is from
- Display whose turn it is to play the game 
- Display a game plan the game has 3 rows and 3 columns 
- As players place their markers on the board, 
- I need to update the table to indicate which player's turn it is. 
- After each round, a winner must be determined.
- If there is no winner, the player must continue playing. 
- If all markers are placed and there is no winner and the game is tied, the game should end. 
- If there is a winner, the game should stop.


## Thoughtful statement 

The way to improve the development of this project would be to include an AI feature, such as player vs. computer. During the early testing phases, more bugs occurred with this feature. In particular, one bug was that the wrong 'winner' was displayed in the game. Consequently, the project would be less credible if it included this feature.

For an OOP-based project, encapsulation was the best feature to include. However, there are three other principles, including abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, that would make this a pure OOP project.
